# Alerts Feature

## Overview
The Alerts feature allows users to view and create alerts.

## Error Handling
Error handling has been added to the Alerts component to manage network errors. If an error occurs while fetching or creating alerts, an error message will be displayed to the user.

## Implementation Details
- The error state is managed using the `useState` hook.
- Error messages are displayed conditionally based on the error state.

For implementation details, refer to the `Alerts.js` file in the `frontend/src/components` directory.
