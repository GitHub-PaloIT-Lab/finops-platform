## Overview
The FinOps Platform is designed to optimize infrastructure expenditure across multiple cloud providers and on-premises datacenters without compromising the availability and reliability of services. This platform will aggregate information from various sources to enable effective real-time decision-making and, eventually, automated decision-making.

## Features
- **Real-time Data Aggregation**: Collects and consolidates data from various cloud providers and on-premises datacenters.
- **Cost Optimization**: Provides insights and recommendations to optimize infrastructure costs.
- **Service Reliability**: Ensures that critical services maintain high availability and reliability.
- **Automated Decision-Making**: Future capability to automate infrastructure decisions based on predefined rules and machine learning models.[^1]
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Offers customizable dashboards for different teams to monitor and manage their infrastructure costs and performance.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Sends alerts and notifications for cost anomalies, performance issues, and optimization opportunities.

## Requirements
- **Data Sources**: Integration with various cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and on-premises datacenters.
- **Data Storage**: Scalable storage solution to handle large volumes of data.
- **Data Processing**: Real-time data processing capabilities to analyze and generate insights.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive and customizable user interface for different teams.
- **Security**: Robust security measures to protect sensitive financial and operational data.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Data Storage**: AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage
- **Data Processing**: Apache Kafka[^1], Apache Spark[^1]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Security**: AWS IAM, Azure Active Directory, Google Cloud IAM

## Getting Started

## Prompt
This prompt was used to generate the readme file above:
`I am the CTO for a large financial organisation in Australia. We have many different teams using multiple different cloud providers and on-premises datacentre to build and operate various services. Some of these services are critical to us and our customer while other less so, e.g. internal systems and development or testing environments. I have been working on a "FinOps" strategy to opitimise our infrastructure expenditure without comporimising the availabiliy and reliability of any services. I want to build a platform that can bring in the required information from various sources and as a first step allow us to make effective decision in realtime. Eventually we would like the platform to make the decisions as well. Create a readme file to summarise the platform, it's features, requirement and technology stack.`
