We use the docs folder to store all the documentation related to the project. The documentation includes the following files:
1. index.md - The main documentation file that provides an overview of the project, features, technology stack, and other relevant information.
2. feature-1.md, feature-2.md, ... - Files that describe each feature in detail, including its purpose, functionality, and implementation.

When you generate the code, update the documentatoin in the docs folder to reflect the changes made to the project. Do not put the actual code in the documentation files; instead, provide a brief description of hoe the feature works and where to find the implementation details in the codebase.

# infrastructure as code
- We use terraform for infrastructure as code.
- The terraform files are stored in the infrastructure folder.
- Ensure terraform code is modular.
- Ensure code be leveraged to create test and production environments.
